# hshub mutual

This is the API which sets on the master PowerDNS replication server.

The TODO list for setting up Mutual is:
* Setup your web server and PHP (we run PHP 7.4)
* Setup sudo to access pdnsutil under the web user
* Import the modified database for PowerDNS/Mutual
* `cd etc && cp config.sample.php config.php && vim config.php`
* Create a cronjob to pull the TLD list as it is required to differentiate between Handshake and ICANN TLDs: `0 0 * * * /usr/bin/php /var/www/html/mutual/etc/tlds.php >/dev/null 2>&1` (modify the path to tlds.php as needed)
